# Presenter

A javascript presentation tool. Each slide is a file. Works with svg, jpg, gif, or pdf files.

Uses <https://choo.io/> for the interactivity and DOM stuff.

## TODO

- [x] Copy over from the private repo and delete non-generic things
- [ ] Create a `bin` cli that can read slides from a current folder
- [ ] Create a `bin` cli that can generate the necessary slides.json file
- [ ] Read and execute a local javascript file so users can inject their own views and/or interactions (`use` and `view`)
- [ ] Create a Sketch plugin to export slides from a .sketch file
